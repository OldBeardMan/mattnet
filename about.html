                    Hi, I'm <span class="intro-highlight">Matt Krupa</span> - a musician and composer from Poland.
                    I create music that tells stories - from cozy forests through frozen Nordic landscapes to a spring at last.
                    My albums are chapters of one bigger journey, and my game
                    <span class="intro-highlight">Mind of Seasons</span> brings these worlds to life.

                        <span class="story-title-label">From Guitar Hero to Real Guitar</span> -
                        It all started when I was 14 and loved playing Guitar Hero. I asked my brother to teach me guitar,
                        but he convinced me that bass would be easier to learn. So I picked up the bass and soon joined
                        a local band where I learned to play by ear.

                        <span class="story-title-label">First Covers</span> -
                        I started recording covers at home, experimenting with whatever equipment I had.
                        My first releases were acoustic covers - simple recordings that taught me the basics
                        of home production. I was figuring things out one step at a time.

                        <span class="story-title-label">In The Autumn Forest</span> -
                        After getting a MIDI controller and Ableton, I decided to compose my first real album.
                        Inspired by C418's atmospheric music, I created 7 tracks that became
                        <i>In The Autumn Forest</i> - the beginning of a bigger story.

                        <span class="story-title-label">Nordic Countries</span> -
                        I wanted to push further - more melodies, better production, bigger soundscapes.
                        The Nordic Countries albums (Norway, Iceland, Winter) expanded the musical universe
                        with cold, atmospheric journeys through imaginary northern lands.

                        <span class="story-title-label">Cats & Lost Kittens</span> -
                        I started exploring electronic music more deeply - remixing old tracks, creating new beats,
                        and releasing the "Cats" series. This led to <i>Lost Kittens</i> - an album of tracks
                        scattered across all my previous albums, finally brought together.

                        All the albums are connected by one story - and now that story is becoming a game.
                        <i>Mind of Seasons</i> transforms each album into a playable world where you can
                        explore, find lost kittens, and discover the secrets hidden in the music.
