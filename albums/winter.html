                        <h2 class="text-white mb-4">I was working on Iceland and Norway albums. Mostly conatins some unused tracks and some random improvisations. First the album was called 'Presents', because I called it 'Christmas album', but you know, the only really christmas song here is 'Pls Come' (which is pretty good I would say), so I changed it to 'Winter' for reasons. Mostly ambient vibes and acoustic (classic Matt). </h2>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            It begins with a song 'Intro'. Yeah original name. The song was created right after realising 'In The Autumn Forest' album. Inspiried by aquatic songs by C418. It is very ambient.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            'For Mom' is the first song dedicated for my family members. You can tell for whom the song is by the name really. It's... em... piano.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            'For Dad' is piano as well, a bit stronger than the previous one.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            'For Sis' is another calming song. I was very inspiried by the snow and how quiet the winter is (and I almost played Minecraft theme there, because I was improvising lol).
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            'For Bro' is finally something different. I took a guitar and improvised some chill tunes in the styles that my brother likes. And I did it! He said the he really liked it, so job well done with this one! Cheers bro!
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            'For Mom's Mom' is a piano improvisation for one of my grandmothers! You can hear there are some random tunes that don't fit. That was my cat stepping on a piano while I was recording. His name is Sprytek. I thought he was worthy having his one music carrier. But I move out and took the piano, so he stayed in the shadows.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            'For Dad's Mom' is for my another grandmother! It does miss the tempo sometimes, but I am like this really. It is a happy and powerfull melody.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            'Oh Come' is a prequel to 'Pls Come'. It was piano part for some deleted cover that I forgor. sry.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            'Pls Come' here you have a christamss song! Or more like Advent song?? idk, but it's the only vocal one on the album. I wrote it about Christ coming to Earth in both Christmas and Parousia.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            'Outro' is another inspiried by C418. It was meant to be epic, but turned out depressing lol. But still my favourite one on the album.
