                            A word of introduction first: Lost Kittens is an album of independent tracks deleted from past and future projects, but also it is my diary of emotions. Sometimes I know from the start that I will be doing
                            a 'Cat' track, because then this track isn't for a specific themed project (as Nordic Countries for example), but just my feelings from everyday life. So yeah, you can listen to my emotions here.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                           Cat 1 - OutTown, which I composed in the beginning of 2023 and released in June same year, was meant to be on the Spring themed album first, but the vibe was different. I was imagining a night sky somewhere away from the city and light pollution, where you can see all the stars clearly.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 2 - WateRun is a leftover of a track composed and used in 2020 in a short film for a YouTuber. Remixed and released in June 2023 as well.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            I composed Cat 3 - I Like Peanut Butter in 2021, when I was really hungry and it was about peanut butter... I'm sorry but I cut out the vocals and remixed it a bit. It's my least favourite one. Released in September 2023.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 4 - Thoughts is a track I composed and released in October 2023. It's the first 'dairy-like' one, because the chaos in the first part represents the amount of thoughts and fears in my head back then, but the other part which is two times slower, represents how I stay calm.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Here comes another deleted track I composed around 2020/2021. Cat 5 - Bit Chaotic was an unfinished one, because I lost my inspiration while I was composing it back then. I came back to this track in October 2023, finished and released it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 6 - Laminal Winter Thing is the most experimental. I tried to make something ambient/laminal. I guess it just has winter vibes in it, like a little more deaf with a feeling when you have being outside at cold winter night just after a lot of snow has fallen down.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 7 - Sprytek is dedicated to my grandma, my biggest fan. It was inspired by a feeling of acceptation when you let someone go, but you know they are in a better place now... Composed and released in the beginning of 2024. You can see Sprytek (my cat) on the single cover and in the music video for this track.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 8 - Forest Music is made around a simple acoustic guitar riff. I have composed this one in March 2024, it's a very calm one. I was inspired by the forest coming to life after winter. It is about a new life in general.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 9 - The Long Kitten is the most recent track that I composed for the album. I had 0 time composing it, that's why it took me 4 months to finish it. It is the longest song I have ever made and I've put a lot of effort into it. It's about nostalgia I guess.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 10 - Journey is the most ambient one and has lyrics in it! I have made it so it can explain the nature of lost kittens and make connections to all of my other albums that are just one long story.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 11 - I Can't Count comes back to deleted songs. I found on my drive a short guitar part with my vocals in it, so I've remixed it. I don't remember when I composed it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 12 - Carbon Dioxide introduces a whole deleted EP that I've decided to put here as well. The EP was about living in a big city and missing nature. This one is about a smell of carbon dioxide during rush hours.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 13 - Oxygen is another one from the deleted EP. It is continuation to the Carbon Dioxide and it's about searching for an oxygen in town (just like in the lyrics!).
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 14 - Fractal was basically on the deleted EP also, it was more rock song, but the guitar part was awful so I've deleted it and left only the marimba thingy with pads.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 15 - Płotka was my improvisation on piano. I don't know when or for what project I've composed it. I have decided to name it Płotka (like I've named Cat 7 Sprytek), because my sisters dog has the same name. AND I've realised that I've named a song (named cat) Płotka, which is a name of a dog, but from a name of a horse, but after all it's a name of a fish.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 16 - Left Things Unfinished is another one I forgot where comes from lol.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 17 - GeryBlock is the last one from the deleted EP. I really like this one. It's about the domination of grey colour in the city.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 18 - scanner is a remix of live version of my first ever released song - printer.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 19 - Missing is about loss. It was very depressive one, but I've remixed it a bit so it won't be so depressing. It was first made as Cat 7, but my wife didn't like the depressive version, so I didn't released it then.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Cat 20 - It's A Peaceful Life is another one that I don't remember making. But I really like this one, I guess it's my favourite. It's very calming and hopeful. It's about my life now. Peaceful life.
                        </p>
